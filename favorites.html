		<p> If it isn't obvious already, this page has all my favorite <strong>games, movies, and music</strong>.</p>
		<p> I mostly came across these choices from just discovering them, whether it be through friends, or my own discovery. </p>
		<p> I chose these specfic choices as they have had a <i>big</i> impact on me, through memories or just the <i>large</i> impact it had on me in general </p>

				<li>Lethal Companmy</li>
			</ol>
		
		<p>Brawl Stars was the game that I've basically stuck with, and as it stands, will most likely be <strong>my favorite</strong> for a long time.</p>
		<p>Roblox was one of the games that I grew up with, and has been one of the ways I can game with my friends, espeically when I didn't have a computer.</p>
		<p>Lethal Company was one of the later games in my life that I've had so much fun with, and to this day I still play with my friends. It has inspired me a lot, and I still look at it quite fondly.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Avengers Endgame</li>
				<li>Five Nights At Freddy's Movie</li>
				<li>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</li>
			</ul>
			<p> While I don't watch too much movies, when I do, they're usually with friends. These movies were chosen, not just because they were awesome to watch, but also because the experience watching it with my friends was memorable to me, and I still view fondly nowadays. </p>

		<h2 id="Musics">Music</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Megalovania</dt>
				<dd>A final boss theme of the character Sans the Skeleton, in the popular indie game Undertale. One of the most iconic tracks of said game.</dd>
				<dt>Bonetrousle</dt>
				<dd>One of the major bosses/character, Papyrus, theme, that would play at your encounter with him at the end of Snowdin (of course from Undertale)</dd>
				<dt>You Can't Run</dt>
				<dd>The second main song of one of the most influential mods of Friday Night Funkin', featuring Sonic.EXE (a popular creepypasta of Sonic the Hedgehog)</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>It was really hard to choose, as I enjoy lots of different tracks, <i>mostly video game music</i>. I chose the first two, as not only are they really banger tracks, but they belong to some of my favorite characters from their games. The last one I chose more so because I personally enjoyed it, and felt it was underrated from the mod it came from. </p>
